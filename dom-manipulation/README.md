### Welcome to the “DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and Working with JSON Data” project!

In this project, I will develop a dynamic web application that generates, manages, and filters content based on user interactions. This project focuses on advanced DOM manipulation techniques, web storage, and handling JSON data.

You will learn how to
- Create and manipulate dynamic content using JavaScript.
- Persist data across browser sessions using local storage and session storage.
- Import and export JSON data to manage the state of your application.
- Implement a dynamic content filtering system.
- Sync local data with a server and handle potential conflicts.

By the end of this project, you will have a robust understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts and be able to create dynamic, interactive, and persistent web applications.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, students should be able to:

1. **Utilize Advanced DOM Manipulation Techniques:**

    - Create and manipulate dynamic content in a web application using JavaScript.
    - Understand and implement event-driven programming to enhance interactivity.

2. **Implement and Use Web Storage:**

    - Use local storage and session storage to persist data across browser sessions.
    - Implement functions to save, retrieve, and manage data stored in the browser.

3. **Handle JSON Data:**

    - Import and export JSON data to and from web storage.
    - Manage JSON data effectively within a web application, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

4. **Filter and Sync Data:**

    - Implement dynamic content filtering based on user-selected criteria.
    - Sync local data with a server, handling potential conflicts and ensuring data consistency.
